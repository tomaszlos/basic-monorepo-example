# Basic monorepo example

---------
### This is an elementary monorepo example used for experiments around git history.

#### [Problem to solve] split the monorepo and clean git history.

### Repo structure
The repo consists of 4 empty React applications created with `create-react-app` utility under `./apps` directory:
- _app1_
- _app2_
- _app3_
- _app4_

There are no modules shared between the apps, nor any configuration. The repository's `master` branch has a couple of commits touching different directories around the repo, and these will be used for experiments.
